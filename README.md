# ðŸš© Welcome to Flagnation! ðŸš©
  
A decentralized market for buying unique flags on the **[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org)** blokchain. There are a total of 10.000 flags and each one of them is unique.

## Who we are

Flagnation is proudly developed by [Olaf Mertens](https://www.instagram.com/olaf.mertens/) (UI designer) and [Ray OrolÃ©](https://www.instagram.com/ray.orole/) (Blockchain engineer).
We are both 16 years old and are truly inspired by the blockchain technology. So that's why we decided to program Flagnation

## How it's made

Flagnation's UI is built with the [React](https://reactjs.org) framework and interacts with the Ethereum blockchain using Web3.<br>
Off course not everything can be stored on the blockchain, because that would be too expensive.<br>
That's why the flag medata is not stored in the ERC721 smart contract itself but on a peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system called  [IPFS](https://ipfs.io).<br>

> The core smart contracts of Flagnation are written in Solidity (solc 0.5) and are available [here](https://github.com/rayorole/flagnation-core).
